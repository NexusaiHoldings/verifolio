/**
 * Top Navigation Configuration — substrate-topnav-001 (2026-05-24).
 *
 * Substrate ships with one nav entry (Home). Each portfolio company's
 * coding pipeline extends this file via F1-001 (per CTO mvp_scope —
 * cto-prompt-nav-requirement-001) to add links to the company's
 * specific feature pages.
 *
 * The substrate's TopNav component reads PRIMARY_NAV_LINKS and renders
 * them in the order declared.
 *
 * Convention:
 *   - Always keep Home as the first entry.
 *   - Group related pages with NavGroup (admin, account, etc.).
 *   - Use relative paths (Next.js route group parens collapse out of
 *     the URL — e.g. apps/web/app/(domain)/configure/page.tsx serves
 *     at /configure).
 *   - Server-only data; no client JS bundled from this file.
